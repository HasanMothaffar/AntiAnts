# AntiAnts - WIP

## Backstory 
One day while you're using your computer, a swarm of ants appeared out of the blue to destroy its internal parts.
You, as a brave warrior, have to fend these ants off. The game consists of five levels, and each one has its own obstacles and scenes.

I'm responsible for creating the 'Monitor' scene, in which you'll have a chance to shoot those messy ants.

## Notes

This is still a work in progress, so the code is messy a bit.

> I'm a JavaScript dev, so all this pointer syntax seems unga bunga to me. This is my humble attempt to make a simple game. Enjoy!
