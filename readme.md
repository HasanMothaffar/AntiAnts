# AntiAnts

## Backstory 
One day while you're using your computer, a swarm of ants appeared out of the blue to destroy its internal parts.
You, as a brave warrior, have to fend these ants off. The game consists of five levels, and each one has its own obstacles and scenes.

I'm responsible for creating the 'Monitor' scene, in which you'll have a chance to shoot those messy ants.

> The code is messy a bit because I'm not as well versed in C++ as in JavaScript.
